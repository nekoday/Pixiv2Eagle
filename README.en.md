## Requirements

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension
2. Install [Eagle](https://eagle.cool/) image management software
3. Ensure Eagle software is running

## Usage
### First-time Setup

1. Launch Eagle software
2. Create a folder in Eagle for storing Pixiv artworks
3. Right-click on the folder in Eagle and select "Copy Link"
4. On a Pixiv artwork page, click the Tampermonkey icon
5. Select "Set Pixiv Folder ID" and paste the copied folder link (e.g., `http://localhost:41595/folder?id=XXXXXX`) or just the folder ID (`XXXXXX` part)
6. Click "OK" to save the settings

### Daily Use
1. Make sure Eagle software is running
2. Visit any Pixiv artwork page (`/artworks/xxxxx`)
3. Click the "Save to Eagle" button on the page to save the artwork to the specified folder

### Folder ID Setting Rules
- If a Pixiv folder ID is set:
  - By default, the script will search for or create artist-specific folders under the specified Pixiv folder
  - If `📂 切换：直接保存到 Pixiv 文件夹（不创建画师子文件夹）` is enabled, artworks are saved directly into that folder
  - If the specified Pixiv folder cannot be found, an error will be displayed
- If the folder ID is cleared:
  - By default, the script will search for or create artist-specific folders in the Eagle root directory
  - If direct-save mode is enabled, artworks are saved directly into the Eagle root directory
  - When cleared, a message will appear: "Folder ID has been cleared, artist folders will be created in the root directory by default"

### Artist Folder Name Template Configuration Rules

- `$uid` represents the artist ID, `$name` represents the artist name
- By default, the artist name is used as the folder name, corresponding to the template `$name`
- A template example: `$uid_$name`

## Feature Details
### Saving Artworks

- After clicking the "Save to Eagle" button, the script will automatically:
  - Retrieve artwork information (title, artist, tags, etc.)
  - Resolve the save base folder (artist folder or Pixiv folder)
  - Download and save the artwork to Eagle
  - Preserve artwork information within Eagle

### Save Location Modes
- You can switch between two modes via the Tampermonkey menu `📂 切换：直接保存到 Pixiv 文件夹（不创建画师子文件夹）`.
- Default mode:
  - Follow the original behavior: create or reuse an artist-specific folder, then save artworks inside that artist folder
- Direct-save mode:
  - Do not create artist subfolders; save artworks directly into the configured Pixiv folder
  - If no Pixiv folder ID is configured, artworks are saved directly into the Eagle root directory
  - The page button changes to "Open Save Folder"

### Artist Folders
- Only applies in default mode
- Each artist will have a dedicated folder created under the configured Pixiv folder
- The folder name uses the artist's name
- The folder description includes the artist's ID for easier management
- Implementation logic:
  1. First, check if a dedicated folder for the artist already exists under the Pixiv main folder
  2. Identify artist folders through the `pid = artistID` in the folder description
  3. If it doesn't exist, automatically create a new artist folder
  4. Newly created folders will automatically be set with the artist's name and a description containing the artist's ID
  5. All artworks will be saved in the corresponding artist's dedicated folder

### Artwork Subfolders
- Manga artworks (`illustType = 1`) or artworks that contain Pixiv series metadata always live inside a series folder under the current save base folder, and each artwork gets its own subfolder named after the title; the artwork subfolder description stores the artwork ID, while the series folder description stores the Pixiv series URL so you can trace the source quickly.
- For other artworks you can control the behavior via the Tampermonkey menu entry `🗂️ 切换：为多页作品创建子文件夹`, which cycles through **Off (关闭) → Multi-page (多页) → Always (始终)**:
  - Off: Any illustrations go directly into the current folder/series folder without creating subfolders.
  - Multi-page: only artworks where Pixiv reports `pageCount > 1` will get a subfolder before the files are saved.
  - Always: every artwork—including single-page illustrations and converted ugoira GIFs—receives a dedicated subfolder.
- All files from the same Pixiv artwork (images or GIFs) reside in the same subfolder, keeping Eagle collections aligned with Pixiv series/chapters.

### Saved Artwork Detection (optional)
- Toggle via the Tampermonkey menu `🔎 切换：自动检测作品保存状态`.
- Flow: fetch current artwork info → locate the save base folder; if the artwork belongs to a Pixiv series, move into the matching series folder, otherwise stay in the current folder.
- First list items in the current folder to match by artwork link; if no hit, traverse its child folders—when a child folder description equals the artwork ID, it is treated as the saved location.
- When a saved item is found, the button text changes to “已保存” and a “🔍” button appears.
- Note: A large number of artworks may cause performance issues.

### Debug Mode
- Debug mode can be enabled/disabled in the Tampermonkey menu
- When enabled, detailed information about the saving process will be displayed

### Upload Time Setting
- The use of upload time feature can be enabled/disabled in the Tampermonkey menu
- When this feature is enabled:
  - Artworks in Eagle will use the upload time on Pixiv as the addition date
  - Since Eagle sorts by addition date in descending order by default, the display order of artworks will be consistent with the artist's upload order
  - Suitable for users who want to view artworks in the order they were uploaded by the artist
- Disabled by default, meaning the actual save time is used as the addition date

### Strict Save Order
- Toggle via the Tampermonkey menu `🔢 切换：按照严格排序保存`
- When enabled:
  - The first page keeps its base modification time; each subsequent page adds +1 (millisecond)
  - The base time follows the Upload Time setting when enabled; otherwise it uses the actual save time
  - Useful for viewing artworks in the original Pixiv page order within Eagle

## Precautions

1. Make sure Eagle software is running before use
2. Pixiv folder ID needs to be configured correctly
3. Saving large files or multi-page artworks may take longer, please be patient. Download speed mainly depends on your network environment and Pixiv server response time
4. Please comply with Pixiv's terms of use and copyright regulations

## FAQ

A: Please ensure:

### Q: How do I get the folder ID?
A: Right-click on the target folder in Eagle, select "Copy Link", and extract the ID part from the link (link format: `http://localhost:41595/folder?id=XXXXXX`)

### Q: What should I do if saving fails?
A: Please check:
- Whether Eagle is running
- If the network connection is normal
